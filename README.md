# Homework 48 (Decorators)

### Create new decorator

*  Add the named parameter **"introduce"** (with the default value **` False `**), in the internal function

*  The decorator function does not interfere with the work of the internal function until the function is called by the **"introduce"** parameter with the value **"True"**

*  If the internal function was called with the **` introduce = True `** parameter, then this function, before returning the result, must be say its **"Name"**
